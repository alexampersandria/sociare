		<blockquote cite="https://chat.openai.com/chat">
			Rust creeps in like a silent thief,<br />
			With its orange hue and gritty teeth.<br />
			It eats away at what was once strong,<br />
			Leaving nothing but decay when it's done.<br />
			<br />
			It starts with a small spot, a speck,<br />
			But soon it spreads and becomes a wreck.<br />
			Iron, steel, copper, it doesn't discriminate,<br />
			Leaving behind a trail of ruin and fate.<br />
			<br />
			The color of rust is both dull and bold,<br />
			A paradox that never gets old.<br />
			It reminds us that nothing lasts forever,<br />
			That even the strongest things can wither.<br />
			<br />
			Rust may seem like a destroyer of sorts,<br />
			But it also serves as a reminder of our mortal sports.<br />
			For every piece of rusted metal we see,<br />
			There is a story of time and history.<br />
